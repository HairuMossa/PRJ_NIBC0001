# PRJ_NIBC0001 â€“ Non Isolated Buck Converter Embedded Sofware

I decided to use **layered software architecture** to abstruct the hardware from the software.

## Layered Architecture Overview

The firmware is divided into distinct **layers**, each with specific responsibilities and dependencies.  

- Upper layers (Application) focus on **high-level logic**.  
- Lower layers (Interface, System) handle **hardware interactions**.  
- Dependencies always flow **downward**:  
  `Application â†’ Controller â†’ Interface â†’ System`


**High-Level Software Architecture**

## Layer Descriptions

### 1. Application Layer
**Purpose**: Implements the systemâ€™s high-level logic and state machines.  
**Responsibilities**:
- Defines operational states (Idle, Running, Error, etc.)  
- Executes the control loop at **10 kHz**  
- Triggers telemetry updates at **10 Hz**  

### 2. Controller Layer
**Purpose**: Encapsulates control algorithms and logic for system behavior.  
**Responsibilities**:
- Implements the **PID controller**  
- Prepares telemetry data  
- Decides when/how to call Interface functions  

### 3. Interface Layer
**Purpose**: Provides hardware-agnostic access to peripherals.  
**Responsibilities**:
- Abstracts **ADC, PWM, CAN, Timers, GPIO**  
- Defines clean APIs for Controller layer  
- Ensures portability for higher layers  

### 4. Lower Layers (System / HAL)
**Purpose**: STM32Cube HAL and low-level hardware initialization.  
**Responsibilities**:
- CubeMX-generated init code  
- Hardware setup (clocks, pins, peripherals)  
- Provides base functions for Interface layer

## Hardware Architecture

The overall hardware architecture is centered around the **STM32F103 MCU** (used for demonstration; not tested on actual hardware).

## Data & Control Flow

- **Timer Interrupts** (10 kHz / 10 Hz) trigger Application logic.  
- **Application Layer** calls into Controller Layer (e.g., run PID).  
- **Controller Layer** requests data from Interface Layer (e.g., ADC voltage).  
- **Interface Layer** interacts with HAL/System Layer.  

### Timing Goals
- Control Loop: **10 kHz** (100 Âµs)  
- PWM Carrier: **20 kHz** (50 Âµs)  
- Telemetry: **10 Hz** (100 ms)  

Timers used: **TIM1, TIM2, TIM3**.

## Requirements & Traceability

A basic requirements specification is provided. Each requirement is uniquely identified and linked to its parent requirement in the **traceability section**.
